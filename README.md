# Running Nussinov's Algorithm

You must have python3 installed on your computer. 
Place input.txt and main.py in the same directory. 
The current input.txt contains an example sequence. 
Populate the first line of input.txt with an RNA sequence. 
An RNA sequence must only be on one line.
Each character must be from the set {A, U, C, G}. 
Enter your terminal and navigate to the directory that holds these files. 
Execute "python3 main.py" in your terminal. 

If you recieve an error saying "Input is not valid", you must remember to not include anything but {A, C, G, U} in the input.txt file. 

Enjoy finding out predicted RNA secondary structures!
